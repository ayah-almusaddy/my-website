            <h2>Background Information:</h2>
            <p>The MBTI, Myers Briggs Type Indicator, is a personality indicator founded by Katherine and Isabel Briggs, inspired by Carl Jung’s work. There are 16 different personality types with four “letters” making up each type. The first is Introversion/Extroversion (I or E); the second is Sensing/Intuition (S or N); the third is Thinking/Feeling (T or F); and the last is Judging/Perceiving (J or P). So if someone is an ISFJ, they are introverted, sensing, feeling, and judging type.</p>

            <h3>Definitions:</h3>
            <p><strong>Extroversion</strong> - someone who gains energy by being around others<br>
            <strong>Introversion</strong> - someone who gains energy by being alone</p>
            <p><strong>Sensing</strong> - someone who processes the world through their reality<br>
            <strong>Intuition</strong> - someone who processes the world through their intuition</p>
            <p><strong>Thinking</strong> - Making decisions through logic<br>
            <strong>Feeling</strong> - Making decisions through feeling</p>
            <p><strong>Judging</strong> - someone who is more decisive and a “planner”<br>
            <strong>Perceiving</strong> - someone who is more open-minded and flexible</p>

            <h3><u>Perceiving Functions: How You Take In Information</u></h3>
            <p><strong>Introverted Sensing (Si):</strong> Stores and recalls past experiences in great detail. Si-users rely on memory, tradition, and personal experience to understand the present.</p>
            <p><strong>Extroverted Sensing (Se):</strong> Using your five senses to perceive the world: sight, sound, touch, smell, taste. Se-users tend to be very grounded in reality and live “in the moment”. They are observant and have good control and perception over their surrounding environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Introverted Intuition (Ni):</strong> Sees underlying patterns and long-term possibilities. Ni-users trust gut feelings and make connections between abstract ideas.</p>
            <p><strong>Extroverted Intuition (Ne):</strong> Explores multiple possibilities and generates creative ideas. Ne-users make quick, unexpected connections between concepts.</p>

            <h3><u>Judging Functions: How You Make Decisions</u></h3>
            <p><strong>Introverted Feeling (Fi):</strong> Makes decisions based on personal values and inner morality. Fi-users prioritize authenticity and staying true to themselves and their values.</p>
            <p><strong>Extroverted Feeling (Fe):</strong> Prioritizes social harmony and considers how actions affect others. Fe-users are highly aware of emotions in their environment and seek to maintain group cohesion.</p>
            <p><strong>Introverted Thinking (Ti):</strong> Analyzes and organizes information based on internal logic. Ti-users focus on accuracy and consistency within their own logical framework.</p>
            <p><strong>Extroverted Thinking (Te):</strong> Focuses on external efficiency, structure, and results. Te-users make decisions based on facts and objective logic, often in a systematic, goal-oriented manner.</p>

            <h2>Tests and Results</h2>
            <p>I took 9 different MBTI tests - some focused on the four letters and others focused on the cognitive functions. I took each test on January 1st and January 31st to test for consistent results. Here’s a breakdown on their accuracy, format, and how useful I think they are. </p>
            <p>Disclaimer: My opinions and interpretations of these tests are completely my own and you have all the right to disagree with me. I am not an expert or a scientist - I’m just bored. </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>If you discuss MBTI tests with anyone - they will all agree on one thing and one thing only: tests can never truly be accurate and should be used as a guide rather than a conclusive measurement. After spending years engaging with ‘MBTI nerds’ and taking numerous tests over and over again - I have come to the conclusion not to “type myself”. As much as I love studying the cognitive functions and the different measurements people have come up with - inspired by Carl Jung’s work, I believe that personality will always be fluid and can always be changed. I do not like to box myself in - whether for a personality type or a hogwarts house - I have always enjoyed my ability to reinvent myself throughout my life. Maybe I’m an ENTJ, maybe an ENFP, maybe I’ve taken these tests too often and know how to answer them to get the result that I want, or maybe it doesn’t matter at all.</p>

            <p>My recommendations:<br>Four Letter Type - Truity<br>Cognitive Functions - Michael Caloz</p>
