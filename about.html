            <h3>“The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.” Gustav Flaubert</h3>

            <p>I am nothing if not obsessive. I ruminate on my thoughts for hours and hours, 
                wondering how to shape them into words. They are merciless and vindictive. I could spend years on the same topic, thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking. I’ll write scraps of poetry. Then I delete them. I’ll write a scene of a story. Then I forget about it. But the act of sitting down and typing on my keyboard, trying to conjure up the right sentences, has been my achilles heel. But there comes a point where the realization hits: there is no such thing as the perfect sentence.</p>

            <h3>“If I waited for perfection, I would never write a word.” Margaret Atwood</h3>

            <p>That is why I have decided to take the plunge and do something I have been yearning to partake in. I am going to write. I am going to start a blog. </p>

            <p>Welcome and let me introduce myself.</p>

            <p>My name is Ayah Almusaddy. I am a junior in university, majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Psychology. I do not know exactly what my career goals are as I am interested in way too much. Despite my lack of clarity on my calling in the workforce, I do know that I have always wanted to be a writer. Specifically - I want to write a novel sometime in my life. I have been an avid reader ever since I learned the alphabet and my love for fiction has shaped my entire life. Now the problem is that I haven’t written much fiction since my high school creative writing course. The perfectionistic monster inside my head will not allow me to type out a page of any story before deleting most of it. So I pretty much put that “writing dream” on hold for a while and focused on school. And while I love college and have become addicted to the taste of academic validation, I have desperately missed the itch of writing words onto paper. Words that inspire hope and beauty and sadness and excitement. Words that make me grin at myself and think I’m smarter than I actually am. So I thought to myself - why not start by creating another blog the internet does not need?</p>

            <p>I want to write about topics that fascinate me. I am planning on organizing this blog (in the future) into different distinct sections, depending on the type of content I write in the first couple of months. I want to write book reviews, discussions on popular topics, random niches of interests I go down the rabbit hole of researching, and whatever inspires words to leak from my brain. I hope that I can entertain, amuse, and surprise my beloved readers. I hope that you feel some sort of emotion from my desperate attempts at voicing my thoughts. And I hope I inspire someone to venture out of their comfort zone and create what their mind has blocked them from creating. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for taking the time to explore my little corner of the internet.</p>
