            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. 
                My love for reading, technology, and law has led me on a journey to explore the 
                intersection of these fascinating fields. When I'm not coding or diving into legal 
                theories, you can find me immersed in a good book!</p>
